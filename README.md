## **Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Video Generation – Experimental Procedure**

### **1. Familiarize Yourself with Video Generation Models**

Begin by exploring AI tools that generate video from text prompts. Popular tools include:

* **Runway Gen-2**
* **Synthesia**
* **Pictory**
* **DeepBrain**

Understand each model’s strengths, capabilities, and limitations—for example, realism, animation support, resolution quality, or motion consistency.

---

### **2. Create Simple Prompts for Video Generation**

Start with short, basic prompts that describe only the primary subject or activity.
**Example Prompt:**
*“A person walking in a park.”*

These simple prompts help you establish baseline output quality for each model.

---

### **3. Experiment with More Detailed Prompts**

Gradually refine the prompts by adding details about the:

* Setting
* Lighting
* Movement
* Expression
* Colors
* Objects in the scene

**Example Prompt:**
*“A person in a red jacket walking along a sunny park path, with birds flying in the sky, and a dog running beside them.”*

This step shows how descriptive richness affects visual clarity and complexity.

---

### **4. Add Time and Motion Elements**

Enhance prompts by including temporal and cinematic elements like:

* Time of day
* Transitions
* Slow motion
* Time-lapse
* Camera zoom or pan

**Example Prompt:**
*“A time-lapse video of the sun setting over the ocean, with the camera slowly zooming out from the beach, capturing waves and changing sky colors.”*

This step tests how well the model handles motion and scene progression.

---

### **5. Test Different Video Styles**

Try various artistic and cinematic styles such as:

* Animation
* Realistic / live-action
* Futuristic or sci-fi
* Cinematic film look
* Artistic or sketch style

**Example Prompt:**
*“An animated scene of a futuristic city at night, with glowing neon lights, flying cars, and a bustling crowd.”*

This helps you observe differences in atmosphere, mood, and rendering.

---

### **6. Iterate and Adjust Prompts**

Review the generated videos and refine prompts to improve:

* Pacing
* Motion consistency
* Light behavior
* Camera angles
* Scene transitions

**Refined Example:**
*“A cinematic shot of a car speeding through a neon-lit city at night, with reflections on the wet street and a high-speed chase sequence.”*

Revisions teach you how specific wording changes the result.

---

### **7. Generate Multiple Versions**

Run the same or slightly modified prompt multiple times to evaluate how phrasing affects output.

For example:

* “A cat jumping on a table.”
  vs.
* “A small orange cat leaping onto a wooden dining table in slow motion.”

Small prompt changes can produce significantly different results.

---

### **8. Save and Compare Outputs**

Store all generated videos for comparison. Analyze differences in:

* Style
* Motion quality
* Scene accuracy
* Visual coherence
* Prompt alignment

This comparison helps identify which prompt structures produce the most consistent and accurate videos.
